# DataIncubatorProject
Project description:
Airports are noisy. Recent studies indicate that noise pollution from airport traffic increases stress level, potentially
increasing the risk of heart disease.  Another impact from noise pollution is on home property values and resale values.
 This project will look at the costs of airport traffic noise pollution on health and wealth. I have collected data from
 several sources on heart disease and local demography (https://www.healthdata.gov/data/dataset/community-health-status-indicators-chsi-combat-obesity-heart-disease-and-cancer,
housing and wealth (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Record+Linkage+Comparison+Patterns; http://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/Public-Use-Databases.aspx), and airports (http://openflights.org/data.html).  The data is large, messy, and will need quite a bit of merging. I will use a maching-learning approach to tease apart how 1) airport volume affects hearth disease, 2) resale values of property and 3) how housing quality can mediate the negative impacts of airport traffice noise pollution on health.
