Project description:
Household energy use is unevenly distributed over any given 24-hour period (Fig. 1). This results in greater pressure on infrastructure during peak-usage times
and untapped capacity at non-peak usage times. One method to spread power usage over the day more evenly is to provide an economic incentive for
household users. Data on active energy consumed within households indicates that households could better spread their power usage across the day (Fig.2). Further analysis will assess the feasibility of spreading out power usage. In particular, whether high peak daytime usage results from
power usage in the kitchen, laundry room, or water heater. I will then assess economic incentives for consumers to spread their power usage, 
costs to power suppliers and new pricing strategies (time-varying) to ensure no net loss for power producers.
